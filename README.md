# Improving Edible and Toxic Plant Recognition with CLIP and Zero-DCE in Challenging Lighting Conditions

## Overview

This repository presents the official implementation and supplementary materials for our research project investigating the integration of **Zero-DCE (Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation)** with **CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining)** to enhance semantic understanding of low-light images. The project explores how illumination enhancement can serve as a pre-processing step to improve the performance of vision-language models in adverse visual conditions.
